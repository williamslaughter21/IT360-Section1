# IT360-Section1(The Smiths)
# GitHub Repository & Programming Project 
Functionality: This project aims to create a networking tool to solve a forensic science problem. Our tool is a custom “Brute-Force Forensic Evidence Capture & Correlation Tool” which correlates hosts logs to their exact packets, which correlates to moments of compromise!

# Code Quality
-Check the report in the next section!

# Written Report(will be in the appropriate file as well)
Here lies our pdf report on our project, each step taken to get to the next step, as well as the results that came after the experiment. To give a little insight, were Simulating a cyberattack where the attacker/attackers use a brute force attack  to compromise a password. This is where we come in, we would first monitor network traffic to see when the attack took place, what was possibly changed and then figure out how to record this data to where we could use it to present in court of law.
